scheduled date by contacting you, as described in Section 13, or your bank. If my ACH bank transfers are
rejected or returned for any reason, I understand and agree that you may try to debit my account two more
times. I also agree you may apply the ACH return/check refund fee described in Section 4, subject to
applicable law, each time an ACH transfer is returned or rejected. I acknowledge that my financial institution
may also charge a fee in addition to your fee and you are not responsible for any such fees. All written
communications concerning disputed amounts, including any check or other payment instrument that (i) is
postdated and accompanied by adequate notice, (ii) indicates that the payment constitutes "payment in full" of
the amount owed, (iii) is tendered with other conditions or limitations or (iv) is otherwise tendered as full
satisfaction of a disputed amount, must be marked for special handling and mailed or delivered to us at Upstart
Loan Operations, P.O. Box 1503, San Carlos, CA 94070.

7\.
Waiver of Defenses. Unless I am a "covered borrower" under the Military Lending Act, 10 U.S.C
§ 987, or except as otherwise provided in this Note or as required by applicable law, you are not responsible or
liable to me for the quality, safety, legality or any other aspect of any property or services purchased with the
proceeds of my loan. If I have a dispute with any person from whom I have purchased such property or
services, I agree to settle the dispute directly with that person.

8\.
Certification. I agree that the proceeds of my loan will not be applied (i) in whole or in part to
postsecondary educational expenses (i.e., tuition, fees, required equipment or supplies, room and board, or
other miscellaneous personal expenses incurred while I am studying) at a college/university/vocational school,
as the term "postsecondary educational expenses" is defined in Regulation Z, 12 C.F.R. § 1026.46 (b)(3), or
(ii) for any home purchase or refinance.

9\.
Default and Remedies. Subject to the limitations of applicable state law and any right to notice and
to cure under applicable state law, I will be deemed in default (each, an "Event of Default") of my obligations
under this Note if I: (i) fail to pay timely any amount due under this Note; (ii) file or have instituted against me
any bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings or make any assignment for the benefit of creditors; (iii) die; (iv)
commit fraud or make any material misrepresentation in this Note or in my loan application; or (v) fail to abide
by the terms of this Note. Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, you may exercise all remedies
available to you under applicable law, including demand that I immediately pay all amounts due under this
Note. You reserve the right to report loan payment delinquencies of 30 days or longer to one or more
consumer reporting agencies in accordance with applicable law. I acknowledge these may be reflected in my
credit report. I agree to pay all costs of collecting any delinquent payments, including reasonable attorneys'
fees, to the greatest extent not prohibited by applicable law.

10\. Prepayments; Partial Payments; Forbearance, I may prepay this Note in full or in part at any time
without penalty. Any partial prepayment is to be applied against outstanding principal and does not postpone
the due date of any subsequent monthly installments, unless you otherwise agree in writing. If I prepay this
Note in part, I agree to continue to make regularly scheduled payments until all amounts due under this Note
are paid. In the event that I prepay my loan in full prior to its maturity date, any origination fee amount in
excess of 5% of the loan amount will be refunded to me on a pro-rated basis depending on the remaining term
of my loan. A partial pre-payment will not result in the refund of any origination fee amount.

Further, I understand I may request forbearance in accordance with your reasonable procedures and
requirements, and the decision to grant my request for forbearance shall be solely at your discretion. During
any period of forbearance, my regularly scheduled payments of principal and interest on my loan may be
deferred to the extent permitted by applicable law. Except as described above, I understand that I will remain
responsible for all interest accruing during any period of forbearance. I understand that any periods of
forbearance may increase my monthly payments during my loan term or, in limited cases, may extend my
repayment period unless prohibited by applicable law.
