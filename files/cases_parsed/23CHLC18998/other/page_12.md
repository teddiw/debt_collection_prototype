L.
Severability: If it is determined that any paragraph or provision in this arbitration clause is
illegal, invalid, or unenforceable, such illegality, invalidity or unenforceability shall not affect the other
paragraphs and provisions of this arbitration clause. The remainder of this arbitration clause shall continue in
full force and effect as if the severed paragraph or provision had not been included. Notwithstanding this
severability provision, if a court of competent jurisdiction determines paragraph G to be void, illegal, invalid,
or unenforceable, the Parties agree that paragraph G above shall not be severed and that this arbitration clause
shall be void in its entirety.

M. Right to Opt Out: If I do not want this arbitration clause to apply, I may reject it by mailing a
written notice to you that lists my name, address and account number and states that I am opting out of the
arbitration clause. An opt out notice is only effective if it is signed by me, and the envelope that the opt out
notice is sent in is postmarked no more than 30 calendar days after the date I sign this Note. If I opt out of this
arbitration clause, it will not affect any other provisions of the Note or my obligations under the Note. If I do
not properly opt out as set forth above, it will be effective as of the date of the Agreement. If I opt out of this
arbitration clause, such election shall apply only to this Note, and not to any other past, present or future
agreements I have with you.

FOR ALL DISPUTES COVERED BY THIS PROVISION, THE PARTIES HAVE AGREED TO
WAIVE THEIR RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY, THEIR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN CLASS
ACTIONS OR CLASS ARBITRATIONS, AND THEIR RIGHT TO SEEK PUNITIVE AND/OR
EXEMPLARY DAMAGES. EXCEPT FOR DISPUTES AND CLAIMS NOT SUBJECT TO THIS
PROVISION, ARBITRATION SHALL BE IN PLACE OF ANY CIVIL LITIGATION IN ANY
COURT AND IN PLACE OF ANY TRIAL BY JURY.

THE TERMS OF THIS PROVISION AFFECT MY LEGAL RIGHTS. IF IDO NOT UNDERSTAND
ANY TERMS OF THIS PROVISION OR THE COST, ADVANTAGES OR DISADVANTAGES OF
ARBITRATION, I UNDERSTAND I SHOULD SEEK INDEPENDENT ADVICE BEFORE SIGNING
THIS NOTE. BY SIGNING THIS NOTE, I ACKNOWLEDGE THAT I HAVE READ, UNDERSTAND
AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY EACH OF THE PROVISIONS, COVENANTS AND
STIPULATIONS SET FORTH ABOVE.

18\.
NO WARRANTIES; LIMITATION ON LIABILITY. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH
IN THIS NOTE, I UNDERSTAND YOU HAVE MADE NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES TO
ME, INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

IN NO EVENT WILL YOU BE LIABLE TO ME FOR ANY LOST PROFITS OR SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY,
CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, EVEN IF I INFORM YOU OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
SUCH DAMAGES. FURTHERMORE, I UNDERSTAND YOU MAKE NO REPRESENTATION OR
WARRANTY TO ME REGARDING THE EFFECT THAT THE NOTE MAY HAVE UPON YOUR
FOREIGN, FEDERAL, STATE OR LOCAL TAX LIABILITY.

19\. Entire Agreement. The Upstart® application, and loan disclosures are incorporated into this Note by
reference. This Note represents the entire agreement between FinWise and me.

20\. Miscellaneous. To the greatest extent not prohibited by applicable law, I am liable to you for your
legal costs if you refer collection of my loan to a lawyer who is not your salaried employee. These costs may
include reasonable attorneys' fees as well as costs and expenses of any legal action. If a law that applies to my
loan and sets maximum loan charges is finally interpreted so that the interest or other loan charges collected or
to be collected in connection with my loan exceed the permitted limits then: (a) any such loan charge will be
reduced by the amount necessary to reduce the charge to the permitted limit; and (b) any sums already
collected from me that exceeded permitted limits will be refunded to me. You may choose to make this refund
by reducing the principal I owe under this Note or by making a direct payment to me. No provision of this
